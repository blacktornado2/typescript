-> What is TypeScript?
- A strongly typed programming language
- TypeScript -> superset of JavaScript, TypeScript = JavaScript + static typing

-> Why TypeScript?
- Limitations of JS: dynamic typing -> run time errors
  - difficult to refactor
  - no information for data 
- Advantages: static typing -> early error detection
  - improved code quality
  - easy to refactor
  - intellisense, code completion(based on defined types)
  - Clear documentation, easy to collaborate

-> How it works
- TypeScript uses compile time type checking
- Browsers and Node.js can't directly run TypeScript. We need to compile it into regular JavaScript. This is where the tsc (TypeScript Compiler) comes in
- TypeScript types are only used during development and compilation. They are not part of the JavaScript runtime.
- The compiler can be configured using a tsconfig.json file
- To create a new tsconfig.json file: npx tsc --init
- Install typesript compiler globally so we can use it: npm i -g typescript
- Check if the compiler is actually installed or not : tsc -v
- TypeScript will throw an error if data types don't match
