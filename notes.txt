-> What is TypeScript
- A strongly typed programming language
- TypeScript -> superset of JavaScript, TypeScript = JavaScript + static typing
- Install typesript compiler globally so we can use it: npm i -g typescript
- Check if the compiler is actually installed or not : tsc -v

-> How it works
- TypeScript uses compile time type checking
- Browsers and Node.js can't directly run TypeScript. We need to compile it into regular JavaScript. This is where the tsc (TypeScript Compiler) comes in
- TypeScript types are only used during development and compilation. They are not part of the JavaScript runtime.
- The compiler can be configured using a tsconfig.json file
- To create a new tsconfig.json file: npx tsc --init
